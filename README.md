## Description

`Slack That!` is a microservice to handle simple message posting to multi Slack workspace.

## Why?

To avoid spreading your tokens in all your services and import a slack library when you can just easily send a HTTP POST to your micro service!

## Work in Progress.

### Tasks 

- [x] yaml parsing - workspace: token
- [ ] Create GET / route - doc
- [x] Designing the POST route
- [x] Create POST / - send message
- [ ] Secure the POST route
- [ ] Dockerize or not.
- [ ] make the README.md more professional

### Ideas

Run out of ideas, atm.
